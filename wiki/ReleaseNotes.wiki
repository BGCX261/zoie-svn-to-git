===API & Behavior Changes===
Due to significant changes in Lucene 2.9.x, we had to make the following API and behavior changes as well.
  * Indexable renamed to !ZoieIndexable, getUID() now returns a long, and buildDocuments changed to buildIndexingReqs.
  * !IndexableInterpreter changed to !ZoieIndexableInterpreter to return !ZoieIndexable
  * !IndexReaderDecorator has a new api: redecorate(), to correct implementation of this api is to just rewrap the inner indexReader, it is guaranteed the !ZoieIndexReader instance passed in contains inner segment that has not changed, merely reopened.
  * !IndexReaderFactory has a new api: returnIndexReaders(), which is a clean up call must now be called after done with the readers. Do not call close() on the readers.
  * !ZoieIndexReader can no longer be new'd, open() factory method is to be called instead.
  * !ZoieSystem now instead returns a List of decorated readers, it now readers a List of !ZoieIndexReaders, and decorated readers can be obtained from !ZoieIndexReader.getDecoratedReaders().
